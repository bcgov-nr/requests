## Step 0

**Are you a member of the bcgov-nr GitHub Organization already?**
If not, you will need to request membership first. Return to the Issues page and fill out that request first.

**Are you sure this is the appropriate organization?**
The vast majority of devops work in the BC Government should have its home in the bcgov organization, which members can create repos in without requiring a request.
This org is exclusively for the use of platform services. If you are not asking for a repo that directly serves the platform itself, your request will almost certainly be denied.

## Step 1
Make sure no duplicated request exists, search here:
https://github.com/bcgov-nr/requests/issues

## Step 2
Fill out the following fields. For security purpose, please provide the following contact information to the email address - pathfinder@gov.bc.ca

* Project Name: 
* Details on repo: 
* Preferred name for repo: 
* GitHub ID for repo owner: @
* GitHub Account 2FA Confirmed: yes or no
* Email address: 
* Organization: 
* Project Role: 


**Note** that the platform services team will be removing GitHub Org access for users that are not active for six months. Once the access has been removed, a new `Access Request` has to be made by the product owner.
