## Step 0

**Are you a member of the BCGOV-NR GitHub Organization already?**

Preferably, someone who is already a member of the BCGOV-NR Github org should request access for you. 
Consider asking someone to submit this ticket in your name in order to ensure that it is processed quickly.

If you do not have access to a team lead or other org member to ask for membership on your behalf, a member of the Platform Experience team will contact you about your request once you have submitted it.
We will need to discuss your needs in a quick meeting before this request can be processed!

**Do you actually need the team member to be a member of the organization?**
- Often, it works just fine to have a team member as a Collaborator on your repository, without them being a member of the `bcgov` GitHub organization. Before submitting this request, consider whether you could simply invite your team member to contribute as a Collaborator.  
  Instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/inviting-collaborators-to-a-personal-repository).

**Are you the admin of your project's BCGOV-NR GitHub Repository?**
If not, you need to ask your project repo's admin to make this request.


## Step 1
Visit DevHub for detailed instruction on creating a request:
https://developer.gov.bc.ca/Getting-Started-on-the-DevOps-Platform/How-to-request-new-GitHub-user-access-or-repository-creation

## Step 2
Make sure no duplicated request exists, search here:
https://github.com/bcgov-nr/requests/issues


## Step 4
Are you requesting to:
- [x] Invite a user
- [ ] Remove a user


## Step 5
Fill out the following fields

* Project Name: 
* GitHub Org: bcgov-nr
* Full Name: 
* GitHub ID: @
* GitHub Account 2FA Confirmed: yes or no
* Email address: 
* Organization: 
* Project Role: 
* GitHub Team to Join (if exists): 
* Existing GitHub Repo: 


**Note** that the platform services team will be removing GitHub Org access for users that are not active for six months. Once the access has been removed, a new `Access Request` has to be made by the product owner.
