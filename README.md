## DevOps Requests:
To get started on the IIT platform, you and your team will need access to certain resources. This is the place to request them.

### In a nutshell:
We are using this GitHub repository to manage the requests. Each request will be in a _GitHub Issue_.

### How to create a request:
- Go to the [Issues page](https://github.com/bcgov-nr/requests/issues)
- Create an issue based on a _Issue Template_ that matches your need. **NOTE**: To enable automation in this process, please follow the instructions and format according to the templates. For any contact information required, __please only provide  business contact information.__
- Once a request has been created, the provisioning process will start. We will post updates on the _GitHub Issue_.


### Request types:

You can find our complete list of request types by clicking on the Issues tab above.

If you cannot find an appropriate request the list, you can request a new request type (there is a request template to do so) or click on the "Human Help" link to get further instructions on how to contact the team for guidance.
